        <h3> Steps </h3>
            <ol>
                <li> <b> Step 1 </b> <br> Heat ghee in a large, nonstick pan over medium heat. Add onion <br> and cook, stirring, until lightly brown, about 8 minutes. Add <br> garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. </li> <br>
                <li> <b> Step 2 </b> <br> Add tomato, serrano pepper, carrots, peas, potato, turmeric, <br> coriander, cumin, fenugreek, chili powder, and salt, and cook, <br> stirring, for about 5 minutes. </li> <br>
                <li> <b> Step 3 </b> <br> Reduce heat to low, cover, and let vegetables steam in their <br> own juices until potatoes are fork tender, about 25 minutes. Stir <br> about halfway through cooking time, and make sure the pan isn't too dry. <br> If vegetables are sticking, add 1 or 2 tablespoons water, replace <br> the lid, and continue cooking. Taste; season with salt.</li> <br>
